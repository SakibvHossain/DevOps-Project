### Phase 1: 
**Network Environment:** `Private, Isolated, Secure` the reason we want to work with network environment is so that all the application we work with or deploy all things should be private. There should be isolated environment so that out side person can't able to access it. Then we have to make sure each and everything is secure. 

**Kubernative Cluster:** Where we will deploy our application.  [Scan it]  
**VMs:** Create multiple virtual machines. This machines should be created on secure network. On this virtual machines we need to setup multiple servers and tools.
